# Hull Seals Donation Site
This is the code and pages that allow the Seals to accept donations through Stripe - and look good doing it too.

# Description
This code serves as a repository and backup to the Hull Seals Donations website, found at https://hullseals.space/donate, including fonts, images, and HTML/CSS.

# Installation
Simply load these files into your web directory and open in a browser. The pages are readable by all major browsers. Donations require JavaScript to be enabled in the browser.

## Requirements
- PHP 7.3+
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- A Web server software such as Apache2 or NGIX.
- A JavaScript-enabled browser.
- This page was written to be used with [UserSpice](https://userspice.com) and the Seal template.

## Usage
To install, download the latest [release](https://gitlab.com/hull-seals/code/website-subsections/donations/tags) from our repository. Upload and extract the files to the directory or subdirectory you wish to install from, and run the composer install and update commands. Then, change the secret key in processing.php.
