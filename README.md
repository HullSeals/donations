# Hull Seals Donation Site
This is the code and pages that allow the Seals to accept donations through Stripe - and look good doing it too.

# Description
This code serves as a repository and backup to the Hull Seals Donations website, found at https://hullseals.space/donate, including fonts, images, and HTML/CSS.

# Installation
Simply load these files into your web directory and open in a browser. The pages are readable by all major browsers. Donations require javascript to be enabled in the browser.

## Requirements
To load the pages, you will require a web browser, which you probably also needed to read this page. Javascript and an active internet connection is required for most functions.

## Usage
Open in browser. It's that simple.
